We are given the quadratic equation

  x² - 5x + 6 = 0.

Step 1: Recognize the Form
 A quadratic equation generally has the form
  ax² + bx + c = 0,
where a, b, and c are constants. In our case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = 6.

Step 2: Factor the Quadratic
 To factor x² - 5x + 6, we look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (6) and add up to the coefficient of x (which is -5). That is, we need numbers r and s such that:
  r × s = 6  and  r + s = 5.
 Since the sign of 6 is positive and we want their sum to be 5 (which is positive), both numbers should be positive. We note that:
  2 × 3 = 6  and  2 + 3 = 5.
 Thus, the quadratic can be written as:
  x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).

Step 3: Solve for x
 Apply the Zero Product Property, which states that if:
  (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0,
then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero:
 • x - 2 = 0  ⟹  x = 2,
 • x - 3 = 0  ⟹  x = 3.

Conclusion:
 The solutions to the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 3.

Additional Note on Importance:
 Quadratic equations appear frequently in numerous areas of mathematics, physics, engineering, and economics. The ability to factor or use other methods such as the quadratic formula is essential when analyzing parabolic functions, projectile motion, and optimization problems.

Example:
 Consider finding the roots of the quadratic equation x² - 9x + 18 = 0. The process is similar:
  Find two numbers that multiply to 18 and add to 9 — which are 3 and 6.
  Thus, the factorization is (x - 3)(x - 6) = 0, giving the solutions x = 3 and x = 6.

Thus, for our original problem, the final answer is:
 x = 2 and x = 3.
