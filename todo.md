- [x] Code generation needs to happen at the same time as audio generation
- [x] Give claude the script so it knows what to generate for video (so it coincides)

- [x] Emphasize generating meaningful animations and long explanatory video with captions (make sure it generates as many tokens as possible)
- [x] Tell claude it does not need to generate voice overs
